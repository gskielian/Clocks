This is the code for a simple talking clock and thermometer. The
hardware I used is as follows.

* An AVR ATmega328P processor.
* A DS1307 TWI/I2C real-time clock.
* A DS18B20 1-wire temperature sensor.
* An SPO256 speech synthesiser.

Most of this code is BSD licenced. Check the source code for
details.

The DS18B20 code is due to Martin Thomas and others:
