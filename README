This is the code for a simple talking clock and thermometer. The
hardware I used is as follows.

* An AVR ATmega328P processor.
* A DS1307 TWI/I2C real-time clock.
* A DS18B20 1-wire temperature sensor.
* An SPO256 speech synthesiser.
* A MMA7660FC accelerometer.

The circuitry is completely stock. The connections between the AVR and
the other chips can be easily inferred from the source code.

Most of this code is BSD licenced. Check the individual source files
for details.

The DS18B20 code is due to Martin Thomas and others:

= To Do =

Hardware:
 - switch off the spo256 when we're not talking
 - backup battery for the time
 - check accuracy and current draw

Serial port interface. Commands:
 - speak these allophones
 - set the time/date/alarm/...
 - arduino bootloader?
